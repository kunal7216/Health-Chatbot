## ðŸ¤– HealthCare ChatBot
Major -1 
(4th year - 7th semester)

Health Care Chat-Bot is a Healthcare Domain Chatbot to simulate the predictions of a General Physician. 

ChatBot can be described as software that can chat with people using artificial intelligence. These software are used to perform tasks such as quickly responding to users, informing them, helping to purchase products and providing better service to customers. We have made a healthcare based chatbot. 

The three main areas where chatbots can be used are diagnostics, patient engagement outside medical facilities, and mental health. In our major we are working on diagnostic.

## :page_with_curl: Brief
A chatbot is an artificially intelligent creature which can converse with humans. This could be text-based, or a spoken conversation. In our project we will be using Python as it is currently the most popular language for creating an AI chatbot. In the middle of AI chatbot, architecture is the Natural Language Processing (NLP) layer.

This project aims to build an user-friendly healthcare chatbot which facilitates the job of a healthcare provider and helps improve their performance by interacting with users in a human-like way.

Through chatbots one can communicate with text or voice interface and get reply through artificial intelligence

Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person. 
Chat bots are used in applications such as E-commerce customer service, Call centres, Internet gaming,etc.

Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. 

A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment.

In any case, the utilization of artificial intelligence in an industry where individualsâ€™ lives could be in question, still starts misgivings in individuals. It brings up issues about whether the task mentioned above ought to be assigned to human staff. This healthcare chatbot system will help hospitals to provide healthcare support online 24 x 7, it answers deep as well as general questions. It also helps to generate leads and automatically delivers the information of leads to sales. By asking the questions in series it helps patients by guiding what exactly he/she is looking for. 

## :scroll: Problem Statement
During the pandemic, it is more important than ever to get your regular check-ups and to continue to take prescription medications. The healthier you are, the more likely you are to recover quickly from an illness.

In this time patients or health care workers within their practice, providers are deferring elective and preventive visits, such as annual physicals. For some, it is not possible to consult online. In this case, to avoid false information, our project can be of help.

## :scroll: Modules Used
Our	program	uses a number of python modules to work properly:

1. tkinter 
1. os
1. webbrowser
1. numpy
1. pandas
1. matplotlib

## :page_with_curl: Algorithm
We have used Decision tree for our health care based chat bot.

Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.It usually mimic human thinking ability while making a decision, so it is easy to understand.
